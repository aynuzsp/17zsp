Bug Fixes
Git for Windows' MSYS2 runtime was patched to fix a bug where setting the environment variable SHELL to an empty string in a shell script would not only fail to pass that setting to non-MSYS2 processes (such as git.exe) but also completely skip all environment variables that sort after said variable.
git clean -dfx no longer follows NTFS junction points (also known as mount points).
A workaround now allows cloning to certain network drives (e.g. Isilon).
Fixed CVE-2019-1211 in MinGit/Portable Git by being more careful about validating the Windows-wide config.

There are now experimental built-in versions of git add -i and git add -p, i.e. those modes are now a lot faster (in particular at startup). You can opt into using them on the last installer page.
PortableGit now comes with a meta credential helper, i.e. a GUI that lets the user choose which of the available credential helpers to use. This should help to avoid storing credentials on other people's machines when running portable Git from a thumb drive.
